4. **Compliance Schedule**: Establish a regular schedule for compliance assessments, particularly when regulations change or systems are updated.

5. **Collaborative Approach**: Involve stakeholders from different departments (IT, legal, business) in the governance process.

6. **Version Control**: Keep track of model versions and document changes between versions.

7. **Audit Trail**: Maintain detailed logs of all governance activities for audit purposes.

8. **Continuous Monitoring**: Set up regular monitoring for bias, toxicity, and other key metrics rather than one-time assessments.
