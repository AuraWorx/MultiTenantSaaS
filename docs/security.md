   - Anomaly detection capabilities

## Security Configuration

### Environment Variables

Secure your application by properly setting environment variables:

```
# Set a strong, random session secret
SESSION_SECRET=<strong_random_string>

# Database connection with credentials
DATABASE_URL=postgresql://<username>:<password>@<host>:<port>/<database>

# Enable HTTPS
NODE_ENV=production
```

### HTTPS Configuration

Always deploy the application with HTTPS in production. Example Nginx configuration:

```nginx
server {
    listen 443 ssl;
    server_name your-domain.com;

    ssl_certificate /path/to/certificate.crt;
    ssl_certificate_key /path/to/private.key;
    
    # Modern SSL configuration
    ssl_protocols TLSv1.2 TLSv1.3;
    ssl_prefer_server_ciphers on;
    ssl_ciphers 'ECDHE-ECDSA-AES256-GCM-SHA384:ECDHE-RSA-AES256-GCM-SHA384:ECDHE-ECDSA-CHACHA20-POLY1305:ECDHE-RSA-CHACHA20-POLY1305';
    
    # HSTS (optional but recommended)
    add_header Strict-Transport-Security "max-age=31536000; includeSubDomains" always;
    
    location / {
        proxy_pass http://localhost:5000;
        proxy_http_version 1.1;
        proxy_set_header Upgrade $http_upgrade;
        proxy_set_header Connection 'upgrade';
        proxy_set_header Host $host;
        proxy_set_header X-Real-IP $remote_addr;
        proxy_set_header X-Forwarded-For $proxy_add_x_forwarded_for;
        proxy_set_header X-Forwarded-Proto $scheme;
        proxy_cache_bypass $http_upgrade;
    }
}
```

### Headers Configuration

Set secure HTTP headers, either in your reverse proxy or in the Express application:

```javascript
// In Express
app.use(helmet({
  contentSecurityPolicy: {
    directives: {
      defaultSrc: ["'self'"],
      scriptSrc: ["'self'"],
      styleSrc: ["'self'", "'unsafe-inline'"],
      imgSrc: ["'self'", "data:"],
      connectSrc: ["'self'", "https://api.example.com"],
      fontSrc: ["'self'"],
      objectSrc: ["'none'"],
      mediaSrc: ["'self'"],
      frameSrc: ["'none'"],
    },
  },
  xssFilter: true,
  hsts: {
    maxAge: 31536000,
    includeSubDomains: true,
  },
  noSniff: true,
  referrerPolicy: { policy: "same-origin" },
}));
```

## Security Best Practices

### Secure Deployment

1. **Principle of Least Privilege**
   - Run the application with a dedicated non-root user
   - Limit permissions to only what is necessary
   - Use application-specific service accounts

2. **Container Security (if using Docker)**
   - Use official base images
   - Scan containers for vulnerabilities
   - Don't run containers as root
   - Use a read-only filesystem where possible

3. **Database Security**
   - Use a dedicated database user with minimal permissions
   - Enable TLS for database connections
   - Implement database firewalls or security groups
   - Regular backups with encryption

### Security Monitoring

1. **Logging**
   - Log security-relevant events
   - Include sufficient context in logs
   - Protect log integrity
   - Centralize log collection

2. **Monitoring**
   - Set up alerts for suspicious activities
   - Monitor for authentication failures
   - Track API rate limiting and unusual patterns
   - Regular review of access logs

3. **Incident Response**
   - Develop an incident response plan
   - Define roles and responsibilities
   - Document escalation procedures
   - Regularly test the incident response process

### Regular Security Reviews

1. **Dependency Audits**
   - Regularly run `npm audit` or equivalent
   - Subscribe to security bulletins
   - Plan for dependency updates

2. **Code Reviews**
   - Conduct security-focused code reviews
   - Use static analysis tools
   - Follow secure coding guidelines

3. **Penetration Testing**
   - Conduct regular penetration tests
   - Address findings promptly
   - Validate security controls

## Authentication Implementation Details

The platform uses Passport.js with a local strategy for authentication. Sessions are stored in PostgreSQL using the `connect-pg-simple` library.

### User Authentication Flow

1. User submits credentials
2. Server validates credentials
3. Server creates a session
4. Session ID is stored in a secure HTTP-only cookie
5. Subsequent requests include the session cookie

### Password Hashing

Passwords are hashed using scrypt with the following parameters:

```javascript
async function hashPassword(password: string) {
  const salt = randomBytes(16).toString("hex");
  const buf = (await scryptAsync(password, salt, 64)) as Buffer;
  return `${buf.toString("hex")}.${salt}`;
}
```

### Session Configuration

```javascript
const sessionSettings: session.SessionOptions = {
  secret: process.env.SESSION_SECRET!,
  resave: false,
  saveUninitialized: false,
  store: storage.sessionStore,
  cookie: {
    httpOnly: true,
    secure: process.env.NODE_ENV === "production",
    maxAge: 24 * 60 * 60 * 1000, // 24 hours
    sameSite: "strict",
  },
};
```

## Authorization Implementation Details

The platform implements RBAC (Role-Based Access Control) to manage user permissions.

### Role Definitions

Roles are defined with specific permissions:

```javascript
const roles = [
  {
    name: "Admin",
    permissions: ["admin:all", "view:all", "edit:all", "delete:all"],
  },
  {
    name: "User",
    permissions: ["view:dashboard", "edit:profile", "view:reports"],
  },
  {
    name: "Viewer",
    permissions: ["view:dashboard", "view:reports"],
  },
];
```

### Permission Checking

Middleware checks permissions before allowing access to protected resources:

```javascript
function checkPermission(permission: string) {
  return (req: Request, res: Response, next: NextFunction) => {
    if (!req.isAuthenticated()) {
      return res.status(401).json({ error: "Unauthorized" });
    }

    const userPermissions = req.user.role.permissions;
    if (
      userPermissions.includes("admin:all") ||
      userPermissions.includes(permission)
    ) {
      return next();
    }

    return res.status(403).json({ error: "Forbidden" });
  };
}
```

## Data Protection Measures

### Multi-Tenancy Implementation

The platform implements multi-tenancy through data isolation at the database level:

1. Each record (AI system, risk item, compliance issue) is associated with an organization via a foreign key
2. Users are associated with exactly one organization
3. All queries include organization filtering:

```javascript
async function getAiSystems(userId: number) {
  const user = await getUserWithDetails(userId);
  if (!user) return [];
  
  return db.select()
    .from(aiSystems)
    .where(eq(aiSystems.organizationId, user.organization.id));
}
```

### Input Validation

All user inputs are validated using Zod schemas:

```javascript
const createAiSystemSchema = z.object({
  name: z.string().min(1).max(255),
  description: z.string().optional(),
  type: z.string().min(1).max(255),
  status: z.enum(['active', 'inactive', 'development']),
});

app.post('/api/ai-systems', isAuthenticated, async (req, res) => {
  try {
    const input = createAiSystemSchema.parse(req.body);
    // Process validated input
  } catch (error) {
    if (error instanceof z.ZodError) {
      return res.status(400).json({ errors: error.format() });
    }
    return res.status(500).json({ error: 'Internal server error' });
  }
});
```

## Security FAQs

### How are user passwords stored?

Passwords are hashed using scrypt with individual salts. The hash and salt are stored together in the database. This approach protects against rainbow table attacks and ensures that even if the database is compromised, the original passwords cannot be easily recovered.

### How is data isolated between organizations?

Data isolation is implemented at the database query level. Every query includes a filter by the user's organization ID, ensuring users can only access data within their organization. This approach is implemented consistently across all API endpoints and database operations.

### How are sessions managed?

Sessions are managed using express-session with a PostgreSQL session store. Session IDs are stored in HTTP-only cookies, which cannot be accessed by JavaScript. This protects against XSS attacks attempting to steal session information.

### What measures prevent cross-site request forgery (CSRF)?

The platform uses same-site cookies and implements CSRF tokens for state-changing operations. CSRF tokens are included in forms and validated on the server to ensure that requests come from legitimate sources.

### How are API endpoints protected?

API endpoints are protected through multiple mechanisms:
1. Authentication checks ensure only authenticated users can access endpoints
2. Permission checks verify the user has the appropriate permissions
3. Input validation ensures all inputs meet the expected format
4. Rate limiting prevents abuse through excessive requests
