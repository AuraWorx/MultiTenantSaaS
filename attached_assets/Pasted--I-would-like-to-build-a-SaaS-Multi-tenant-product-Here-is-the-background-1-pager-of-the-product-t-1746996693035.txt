I would like to create a three tier application stack. Frontend, Backend, DB (postgres), backend is driven by apis, frontend only tasks to backend using APIs. 
1) i would like you to start with basic features which basis SaaS features like multi tenant and RBAC. 
2) multi page UI with sidebar having dashboard, Map, Measure, Manage, UserManagement
3) Dashboard is pretty much highlights from Map, manage and Measure
4) User Management can be standard RBAC. 
5) Create a admin org, with admin user, and create a tenant org called demo_org and create a demo_org_user for testing.
6) For each of the Map, Measure and Manage sidebar screens, i would like the features to be selection bar at top of each page. 
7) Lets leave Map, Measure, Manage as placeholders for now, blank page is fine.. i will develop these pages in the next iteration. 
8) I would like separate apps for frontend and backend.
